* Basic Commands
-----------------
-> Windows - GUI, CLI
-> Linux -> CLI (Command Line Interpreter - Shell and the language used to interact with the shell is called Bash);

-> In windows filesystems are assigned to drive letters -> C:, D:, or X:.
-> Each drive letter is a filesystem;
-> Root directory of C: -> C:\ , D: -> D:\ , X: -> X:\;
-> Subdirectories are separated by backslashes (\), in Linux (/) forward slashes;

-> Size V/v Size on disk:
The Size on disk measurement is more complicated. 

If the drive supports compression (as reported by the FILE_FILE_COMPRESSION flag returned by the Get­Volume­Information function) and the file is compressed or sparse (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_COMPRESSED, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SPARSE_FILE), then the Size on disk for a file is the value reported by the Get­Compressed­File­Size function. 

This reports the compressed size of the file (if compressed) or the size of the file minus the parts that were de-committed and logically treated as zero (if sparse). If the file is neither compressed nor sparse, then the Size on disk is the file size reported by the Find­First­File function rounded up to the nearest cluster.

* Various Command Line Interfaces on Windows:
---------------------------------------------
1. Command Prompt: cmd.exe
2. PowerShell: powershell.exe

c.1 ls C:\            -> lists contents of C: 
c.2 Get-Help ls       -> brief summary of the command parameters;
c.3 Get-Help ls -Full -> description of each parameter and examples of how to use the command;
c.4 ls -Force C:\     -> lists hidden directories;
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Command Line Interface on Linux:
-----------------------------------
-> Linux Main directory - Root directory - / (ForwardSlash);
* Flag is a way to specify additional options for a command;

c.1 ls /
c.2 ls --help
c.3 man ls (manual pages - for more information)
c.4 ls -l (detailed information of the folders in a formatted long list)
(file information - no of links the file has - file owner - file group - file size - timestamp - file/directory name);
c.5 ls -la (all files displayed even hidden);
